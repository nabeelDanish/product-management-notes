1. Being Data Oriented
    - Data analysis is very important
        - Apply mathematical and scientific methods on data
        - Test your hypothesis using data
        - Follow the scientific method

    - A good product manager is a scientist
        - Back anything you claim with data
        - Prevents poor and rash decisions
        - No room for opinions since its all data driven
        
    - As a PM, you want the most value from the least risk and data helps you identify risks

2. Humbleness
    - PM should always operate on data
    - Resist temptation to add charms and stuff, let data speak
    - As umer adnan says: "keep your head down and keep doing the good work"
    - No need to add razzle and dazzle in your pitch. Let your idea speak
    - You are not doing this alone. Everything is made by a team
    - It should never be "I" it should be "We"

3. Challenging Yourself
    - Strive to perfection, be never sure that you did the best job
    - Use this as a sanity check, not to create self-doubt
    - Just ensure that you are double checking everything
    - Do not dismiss every idea
    - Coming up with a great product idea is like rolling a dice with destiny
    - If you think you don't have time to double check, than make it 
    - It is a culture. You have to cultivate this in your team

4. Empathy and Respect
    - Use your understanding from User Experience Engineering
    - It is always easier to repair than to replace
    - When people leave, they always blame the managers, not the positions
    
    - How to be empathetic:
        - Listen to people attentively where the goal is to understand
        - See if you can spot if they are not happy and try and understand why
    
    - If your team knows they can count on you, then you can count on them
    - Never force help. Put it out on a plate, and let them grab it for themselves. 
    - If there is a conflict, make sure it is resolved using a one-on-one, after everyone has cooled down

5. Integrity
    - Practice of being honest
    - Showing
        - A consistent and uncompromising adherence
        - To strong moral and ethical principles and values
    
    - Why have integrity?
        - People trusts you
        - Do not play people politics
        - It shows that you are dedicated to the cause
    
    - Admit what's wrong, take the blame. 
    - Lead by example, when you take responsibility, your team will do too
    - Having integrity means being truthful, but that does not mean brutally honest
        - Use empathy to mold truths so that they are easy to digest

6. Diplomacy
    - You need to realize you will be saying "NO" a lot of times
        - Like discarding requests
        - Not taking more work
        - Not allowing all ideas to go
    
    - You have to be strategic about your NOs
        - Explain your train of thought
        - Share your data, make a stellar case
        - Make them excited about what is to come
    
    - Be empathic
        - Tell them you understand their PoV
        - Take time to research your NO
    
    - Conflict between business and tech people
        - Remember, business always comes first
        - You are creating the product to deliver value
        - This is something that you need to be very good at communicating
    
    - Sometimes you have to bend the knee to the stakeholders
    - Diplomacy means aligning the company values with yours so that the product can succeed
    - Any diplomat is out of war, that means no company politics

7. Transparency
    - This is taken from SCRUM or Agile
    - Everyone in the team and the management needs to be transparent
    - Things like vision, strategy, and values, should be the most transparent
    - This helps you avoid issues in product and processes
    - Good product managers will regularly update their team with information
    
    - You still need to be strategic with transparency
        - Telling the truth is always preferred but not the brutal honest truth
        - Be transparent without showing the direct results 
        - If there is secrecy be transparent about why the secrecy (for example: sensitive details about a product)

    - Transparency does not mean pointing fingers
        - Give all the information but do not point finger
    
    - Most important part about transparency is DOCUMENTATION

8. Being Ahead of the Game
    - Talk to clients that are leaving/coming to you from a competitor
        - Understand their products and innovate
        - Understand your competitor's motivation and values
        - Understand how your competitors are seen/perceived by the market
    
    - React quickly to internal company changes
        - Position openings, new tech demos
        - New clients

    - Be on the top of industry knowledge

        - Identify trends, and needs of your clients
        - Use google alerts, grow your LinkedIn network
        - Visit industry conventions and conferences

    - Thinking ahead doesn't just mean thinking like what will happen in the next 2-3 years
        - Think far ahead in the future
        - What will happen if your product becomes obsolete?

    - Being ahead of the game also means developing yourself
        - Your skill sets
