1. Collaboration
    - Product Managers never work alone
    - A great product manager is a great team player
    - Use the strong suites of people around you
    - Delegate as much as you can, and people are trained at doing things better than you
    - Make sure you are not the single point of failure

2. Communication
    - Get all the information that you need
    - Ask as much questions as you can explain the same thing after getting waked up in the middle of the night
    - Ask questions since you are goal-oriented
    - Write down as much as you can. Take notes, meeting notes. Remember the details

3. Confidence
    - Communication is always supported by Confidence
    - You can be confident if you are data-driven
    - Confidence is always need to be communicated with the correct use of language
    - Accepting flaws and mistakes help you gain confidence of the team

4. Curiousness
    - To be the person who is confident, you need to do your homework
    - Doing your homework means being curious and asking a lot of questions

5. Being Data Oriented
    - Data analysis is very important
        - Apply mathematical and scientific methods on data
        - Test your hypothesis using data
        - Follow the scientific method

    - A good product manager is a scientist
        - Back anything you claim with data
        - Prevents poor and rash decisions
        - No room for opinions since its all data driven
        
    - As a PM, you want the most value from the least risk and data helps you identify risks

6. Humbleness
    - PM should always operate on data
    - Resist temptation to add charms and stuff, let data speak
    - As umer adnan says: "keep your head down and keep doing the good work"
    - No need to add razzle and dazzle in your pitch. Let your idea speak
    - You are not doing this alone. Everything is made by a team
    - It should never be "I" it should be "We"

7. Challenging Yourself
    - Strive to perfection, be never sure that you did the best job
    - Use this as a sanity check, not to create self-doubt
    - Just ensure that you are double checking everything
    - Do not dismiss every idea
    - Coming up with a great product idea is like rolling a dice with destiny
    - If you think you don't have time to double check, than make it 
    - It is a culture. You have to cultivate this in your team

8. Empathy and Respect
    - Use your understanding from User Experience Engineering
    - It is always easier to repair than to replace
    - When people leave, they always blame the managers, not the positions
    
    - How to be empathetic:
        - Listen to people attentively where the goal is to understand
        - See if you can spot if they are not happy and try and understand why
    
    - If your team knows they can count on you, then you can count on them
    - Never force help. Put it out on a plate, and let them grab it for themselves. 
    - If there is a conflict, make sure it is resolved using a one-on-one, after everyone has cooled down

9. Goal Orientation
    - Plans should not be focused on because they are going to change
    - Setbacks and failures means that not all plans work
    - Being Agile and Flexible in your thinking is important
    - You can only be Agile and Flexible when you have a goal
    - Remember, having a compass is better than having a map
    - Goals and Metrics will help you stay directed and make focused efforts

    - Being a team player is important but you also need to be a leader

11. Listening

    - You are always presented with a lot of information
    - Details matter, so active listening is going to be very important
    - You need to be able to listen to noise and information, and get better at telling them apart

12. Passion
    - Passion will give you more energy 
    - Having an internal passion will give you a internal pull, instead of relying on something external to push you
    - Ask yourself everyday, if this was the last day for you, would you keep doing what you are doing right now?
    - If the answer is no for a long time, than things need to change
    - Your product is going to be your brainchild. You need to take care for it and nurture it for growth
    - Every product has problems and failures and setbacks.
    - Being passionate about your product will give you the energy to fix it, rather than let it be

13. Prioritization
    - Being able to recognize what is the most important things to do
    - Your team can do anything and everything, but they need to prioritize tasks
    - This is always a hard choice, since you need to pick a few ones at the right time
    - It is important to free yourself from regret, since prioritizing the wrong thing is part of the job
    - Trust your choices and your prioritizes, and use data to drive them

14. Proactive
    - Do not go passive about the knowledge stream
    - Being reactive always will give you the same result every time
    - Being proactive is like playing lottery. 
        - If you can increase the number of plays, you can increase the chances of winning

15. Problem Focus
    - Being a product manager is not about adding features
    - You are trying to solve a problem and add value
    - Adding new features is not always the way to solve the problem

        - You do not need a new feature but need to fix an existing one
        - You need to have a better UXE or UI experience for your users
        - You need to have better training of the users or have better onboardings

    - Being a great communicator does not mean you are a great storyteller
    - Storytelling always helps you talk to business people and clients and your team
    - Using personas, metaphors, and contexts is important to tell a good story
    - Using the right number of words is also important
    - Storytelling is directly linked to presenting and demoing 
    - This is a very very advanced trait and very difficult to master
    - Refer to the Iphone 1 Keynote by Steve Jobs, which is often regarded as one of the best presentations ever

17. Technical Skills
    - Of course having the technical skills for the domain and the tool you are designing is important
    - In a multidisciplinary team, always ask your team members or team leads to give you a simplified explanation of the technical stuff
        - That can be like a small sessions where you learn Embedded, Engineering, Science, etc etc
        - For software teams
            - Understanding databases, releases, version control is important
            - Understanding manual and automated testing is important as well
            - Learn about AI technology is also important
        
    - Do not become a Technical leader or team lead for technical stuff
        - You are not concerned with the HOW of the things
        - You should be concerned with
            - WHAT the problem is
            - WHY to solve it
            - WHEN to solve it
    
18. Transparency
    - This is taken from SCRUM or Agile
    - Everyone in the team and the management needs to be transparent
    - Things like vision, strategy, and values, should be the most transparent
    - This helps you avoid issues in product and processes
    - Good product managers will regularly update their team with information
    
    - You still need to be strategic with transparency
        - Telling the truth is always preferred but not the brutal honest truth
        - Be transparent without showing the direct results 
        - If there is secrecy be transparent about why the secrecy (for example: sensitive details about a product)

    - Transparency does not mean pointing fingers
        - Give all the information but do not point finger
    
    - Most important part about transparency is DOCUMENTATION

        - Think far ahead in the future
        - What will happen if your product becomes obsolete?

    - Being ahead of the game also means developing yourself
        - Your skill sets

        - Do not play people politics
        - It shows that you are dedicated to the cause
    
    - Admit what's wrong, take the blame. 
    - Lead by example, when you take responsibility, your team will do too
    - Having integrity means being truthful, but that does not mean brutally honest
        - Use empathy to mold truths so that they are easy to digest

21. Diplomacy

    - Sometimes you have to bend the knee to the stakeholders
    - Diplomacy means aligning the company values with yours so that the product can succeed
    - Any diplomat is out of war, that means no company politics
